* simonspeck

Package simonspeck implements the Simon and Speck families of NSA
block ciphers. It is a straightforward translation of the pseudocode
in the paper [[http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/404][Beaulieu, et al]] into golang. Each cipher implements the
cipher.Block interface (godoc crypto/cipher). THIS IMPLEMENTATION IS
NOT CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY SECURE. For details on this implementation, see
the inline documentation.
